<p>Mind and technology in harmony.

Activibe is developing a web and mobile application that will help mental health professionals benchmark patient progress and measure treatment outcomes by engaging patients in tracking their emotional state, activities, and energy level. The goal of Activibe is to increase the efficacy and efficiency of clinical mental health by boosting patient involvement in their own care and treatment, while also providing quantifiable data to clinicians that will better enable them to help their patients.

We are in the process of developing an alpha version of our product and recruiting test users. If you are mental health professional and would like to receive updates on our recruitment process please sign up below.</p>
